# Confusion_matrix
### There are four data sets representing different conditions of an experiment. All have the same attributes.

#### a. adult-stretch.data Inflated is true if age=adult or act=stretch

#### b. adult+stretch.data Inflated is true if age=adult and act=stretch

#### c. small-yellow.data Inflated is true if (color=yellow and size = small)

#### d. small-yellow+adult-stretch.data Inflated is true if (color=yellow and size = small) or (age=adult and act=stretch)

##### Color: yellow, purple
##### size: large, small
##### act: stretch, dip
##### age: adult, child
##### inflated: T, F

### we have to make a predicition for the inlated (T,F)

#### We will use this dataset to explane the confusion matrix and calculate the results and the use matrixs (classification report and accuracy) to shee the results .
